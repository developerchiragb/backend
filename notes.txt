Passport JS - It is authentication middleware.

middleware means that it gets executed before our control reaches to the controller.

in the middleware only we can find out which user is requesting so we can process accordingly.

Passport uses session cookies which stores session as well as encrypted cookies.

Passport has done as an argument which is a callback and it reports to the Passport regarding the authentication function we written if there is some error or if the user is not found or if the user is found.

it takes two argument first error and second user is found or not.

Passport has two functions one is serialize function and another is deserailize function.

serializing function that means we are creating session and encrypting the cookie and storing it that will represent its identity.

deserailizing means when we are decrypting the cookie and finding user from the database which user is making the request so we can respond accordingly.

SASS -> Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets 
We will use node-sass-middleware to use sass in our node application.
SASS vs SCSS ->
Two different way of writing.

SCSS is the most commonly used one and SASS is the indentent syntax of SCSS.

<div>
    <p>
        <a>
        </a>
    </p>
</div>
In CSS syntax -->
div p a
{

}
div p 
{

}
In SASS -->
div 
style for div
    p
    Style for div
        a
        Style for div
In SCSS -->
div {
    style for div if required.
    p
    {
        style for p if required.
        a
        {
            style for a if required.

        }
    }
}

at last SASS and SCSS will be converted to CSS only because our broweser only understand CSS but we good a good way of writing CSS using SASS and SCSS.

It converts the scss in to css precompile those files.
whenever i run the server convert all the files of scss in to css and place them in a folder.
because when the page will load and at that time if the files will get compiled then it will lot of time to page to load therfore we are doing the time of server start.
